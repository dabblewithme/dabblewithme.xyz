      <description>I have wrote about second printerbut now I think I have needs for it. Let me explain.
I have been printing a lot. And I think I&amp;rsquo;ve fixed some issues mentioned earlier. I will write more about that, but to the point. I need bigger build volume.
I printed some sock blockers for my wife and had to split them apart. So my Ender 3 Pro 235x235mm build volume is too small.</description>

      <description>I have been using my Ender 3 Pro 3D printer for over a year now. So I have been printing upgrades and also I have purchased some upgrades! Here are some of my favorites.
BLTouch This is probaply one of my favorite upgrades to my 3D printer that I have bought. BLTouch makes the whole bed leveling/tramming process super easy. Configure once and then just print.
Installation is quite easy and then you just need to configure Marlin and dabble with settings.</description>
