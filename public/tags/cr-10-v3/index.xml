      <description>I have wrote about second printerbut now I think I have needs for it. Let me explain.
I have been printing a lot. And I think I&amp;rsquo;ve fixed some issues mentioned earlier. I will write more about that, but to the point. I need bigger build volume.
I printed some sock blockers for my wife and had to split them apart. So my Ender 3 Pro 235x235mm build volume is too small.</description>
