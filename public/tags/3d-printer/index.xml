      <description>Well here it comes. Some list of issues that I have at the moment with my TFT35 E3 v3.0 touch display. I will update this post or make a new post if I get some of them fixed.
M600 / Filament change I tried multicolor printing with filament change middle of the print. I used PrusaSlicer to do M600 (filament change) command on specific layer. It worked just fine with the stock display that my Ender 3 Pro had.</description>

      <description>I have been using my Ender 3 Pro 3D printer for over a year now. So I have been printing upgrades and also I have purchased some upgrades! Here are some of my favorites.
BLTouch This is probaply one of my favorite upgrades to my 3D printer that I have bought. BLTouch makes the whole bed leveling/tramming process super easy. Configure once and then just print.
Installation is quite easy and then you just need to configure Marlin and dabble with settings.</description>
