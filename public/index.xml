      <description>I have been using my Ender 3 Pro 3D printer for over a year now. So I have been printing upgrades and also I have purchased some upgrades! Here are some of my favorites.
BLTouch This is probaply one of my favorite upgrades to my 3D printer that I have bought. BLTouch makes the whole bed leveling/tramming process super easy. Configure once and then just print.
Installation is quite easy and then you just need to configure Marlin and dabble with settings.</description>

      <description>Hello World! This is basically a guaranteed first post for programmer!
Welcome to my brand spanking new blog. I do not remember how many blogs I&amp;rsquo;ve had but not so many in english. I have some finnish blogs but this is the first english one that will tackle my hobby with 3D printing and tinkering around stuff.
This blog is also my first project with Hugo. So this will be interesting project for that.</description>
