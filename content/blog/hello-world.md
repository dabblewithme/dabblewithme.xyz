**Hello World!** This is basically a guaranteed first post for programmer!

Welcome to my brand spanking new blog. I do not remember how many blogs I've had but not so many in english. I have some finnish blogs but this is the first english one that will tackle my hobby with 3D printing and tinkering around stuff.

This blog is also my first project with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). So this will be interesting project for that. Previously I've dabblet with Ghost and done most of my blogs with WordPress.

Here are some keywords for upcoming articles: Ender 3 Pro, SKR Mini E3 v2.0, TFT35 E3 v3.0, Hugo, filament detection, 3D printing, soldering

At this moment I have social media accounts created but there are no content there yet. 

If you like that kind of stuff then welcome aboard!
